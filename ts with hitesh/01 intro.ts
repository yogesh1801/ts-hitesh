 // basic syntax var name : type = value
export {} // why this ? will see afterwards
let greetings : string = "hello yogesh"
console.log(greetings)

//number , contains all sort of things
let userId : number = 555

// boolean
let isLoggedIn : boolean = false

// but this is not good practise as we are mentioning very obvious things

let userIdNew = 666 // automatically takes up the type of the var

// using any keyword is a bad practise
